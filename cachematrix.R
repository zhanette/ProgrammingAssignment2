## Programming Assignment number 2:  Write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.


## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve 
## should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
